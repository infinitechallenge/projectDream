2017 Program Year Data Files

The file geography.csv file has the BLS geography
areas and codes.

The file ONet_Occs.csv contains O*Net 21.0 occupational information, including
the Job Zone and the DOL Education and Training Code.

The file XWalk_Plus.csv contains records that match the O*Net 21.0 occupations
to the corresponding OES/SOC occupations. 

The oes_soc_occs.csv file has codes and definitions for the Standard 
Occupational Classification System as modified by BLS for use in the OES program.

The ALC_Export File includes data from all industries and should be used for 
most prevailing wage determinations.

The EDC_Export File includes data from educational/research institutions only
and should only be used for requests from institutions that are covered by 
ACWIA.

Both wage files include the Average wage for use in H-2 programs. That wage is
not a valid wage level for H-1 or Permanent case prevailing
wage requests.
